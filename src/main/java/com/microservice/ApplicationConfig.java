 * In this class, which uses the @Configuration Spring annotation to indicate

 * which is our ResourceManager responsible for exposing REST services for the 
 * consumers.In a real application, this class would be also creating datasources for access to 
 * databases and other resources, but in order to keep it simple enough to be able to focus on the 
 * Spring Boot, we will use mocks to represent the data access.
 * 
 *  This class, one of the new features in the Spring Framework, is a standardized and very simple 
 *  interface that facilitates the consumption of REST services
